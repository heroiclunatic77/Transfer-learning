# Human Activity Recognition
This Project aims to develop a robust and efficient Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) model that accurately classifies human activities from labeled image data
into 6 distinct categories. These categories include activities such as ‘calling’,
‘cycling’, ‘dancing’, and ‘texting’, among others. 

Model Architecture: Developing a deep CNN architecture comprising
convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers. 
Will also explore transfer learning using pre-trained models like ResNet 50
